## Desciption

UpCourse is a tutorial app which helps user learn skills in different domains like app dev, web dev etc. The app provides top courses of variety of domains from the youtube platform.

## The Problem it solves

Because technology is constantly being updated, YouTube serves as a platform for these updates to reach a large audience.
A lot of people can't afford paid courses on various Edtech platforms like Coursera, Udemy, etc. So UpCourse provides students all the top and highly-rated youtube courses of different domains including their study material at one platform and free of cost. In this way the students can use only one platform to study their favourite domain saving their time and money!
